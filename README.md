## User Experience (UX) <a name="ux"></a>

## Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>

### Project Goals <a name="project-goals"></a>

The main business goal for Dessert Island is to provide users with a blog-style website with various dessert recipes accessible for the user to view. The user can create an account to be able to further interact with these blog posts via likes and adding comments. 

The main target audience for this website are cooking/baking and dessert fanatics who enjoy experiencing new type of desserts and following recipes coming from different levels of background with their cooking/baking skills. This is also a website for users to be able to share their comments and reviews of the recipes with the community.

## Scope <a name="scope"></a>

To achieve the strategy goals, I want to implement the following features:

* A fully responsive design that will work on different devices including desktop, tablets, and mobile devices, allowing users to access the site anytime and anywhere.


## Design <a name="design"></a>

### Colours <a name="colours"></a>

I have used white for the overall background colour for the website, accompanied by black and #212529 for the header and footer to notably distinguish this from the main content. 

For the text, black has been used against the white background and white has been used against the black header and footer. This opposite contrast has been chosen for ease of visibility, so users are able to read the text without any additional difficulty.

In addition, rgb(214, 170, 255) has been used as a complementing accent to the website for the logo and hover links without causing any distractions to the user viewing the website.


### Typography <a name="typography"></a>

The fonts were obtained from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

For my logo text I have used Pacifico.

For the heading text I have used Poppins.

For the main text I have selected Montserrat which complements the font used for my headings and logo. 

I have avoided using overly stylised fonts, which can be difficult to read for users, therefore ensuring the website is more accessible to users with visual impairments.

In the event the font fails to load, I have used sans-serif as a back-up font.


### Imagery <a name="imagery"></a>

Images are obtained from the [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) websites.

I have used imagery appropriate to the websiteâ€™s content to provide a more visual experience to the user.

Please see further details in the __Credits__ section for the specific images used within the project.


## Skeleton <a name="skeleton"></a>

### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://www.balsamiq.com/).

The wireframes have examples of desktop, tablet, and mobile phone displays.

* [Home](docs/images/home.png)
* [About Us](docs/images/about-us.png)
* [Blog Post](docs/images/blog-post.png)
* [Register](docs/images/register.png)
* [Login](docs/images/login.png)

Overall, the finished project design is similar to what I had originally intended to create as per my wireframes. However, there are some different choices I have made for the end website such as:

* I have decided to remove the 'Recipes' section from the nav as per the original wireframes. The original intention was that a user can click on this and will be taken to a new page where they are able to view all the posted recipes. However, this was a redundant idea as the posts were already displayed on the 'Home' page. Therefore, for final submission I opted for a search bar to replace this. The user instead can utilise the search bar to locate specific recipes with the use of keywords which in return will present recipes (if any found).

* There are also some minor differences on the blog post section with the arrangement of the content.

### Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

Due to time constraints, I was unable to apply additional features, in the future I would like to implement the following:

* Allow users to edit/delete their own posted comments. Verification would need to be added to ensure that the user is only able to edit/delete their own comments and be restricted from amending any other users' comments.

* Allow users to create their own posts, this would go to Admin for approval to ensure that the content is consistent and appropriate to the website.

* Add a tick list on the blog post section for the recipes. This will allow users to tick off against each of the ingredients to signify which items they have and which they do not. This was added as a User Story for the Poject section in GitHub, however was out of scope for this project at this moment in time as it was not necessary for the website to function.
