## User Experience (UX) <a name="ux"></a>

## Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>

### Project Goals <a name="project-goals"></a>

The main business goal for Dessert Island is to provide users with a blog-style website with various dessert recipes accessible for the user to view. The user can create an account to be able to further interact with these blog posts via likes and adding comments. 

The main target audience for this website are cooking/baking and dessert fanatics who enjoy experiencing new type of desserts and following recipes coming from different levels of background with their cooking/baking skills. This is also a website for users to be able to share their comments and reviews of the recipes with the community.

## Scope <a name="scope"></a>

To achieve the strategy goals, I want to implement the following features:

* A Home section which will allow the user to find out about the website and view posts.
* An About Us page to inform the user about this website.

## Design <a name="design"></a>

### Colours <a name="colours"></a>

I have used white for the overall background colour for the website, accompanied by black and #212529 for the header and footer to notably distinguish this from the main content. 

For the text, black has been used against the white background and white has been used against the black header and footer. This opposite contrast has been chosen for ease of visibility, so users are able to read the text without any additional difficulty.

In addition, rgb(214, 170, 255) has been used as a complementing accent to the website for the logo and hover links without causing any distractions to the user viewing the website.


### Typography <a name="typography"></a>

The fonts were obtained from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

For my logo text I have used Pacifico.

For the heading text I have used Poppins.

For the main text I have selected Montserrat which complements the font used for my headings and logo. 

I have avoided using overly stylised fonts, which can be difficult to read for users, therefore ensuring the website is more accessible to users with visual impairments.

In the event the font fails to load, I have used sans-serif as a back-up font.


### Imagery <a name="imagery"></a>

Images are obtained from the [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/), [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/) websites.

I have used imagery appropriate to the websiteâ€™s content to provide a more visual experience to the user.

Please see further details in the __Credits__ section for the specific images used within the project.


## Skeleton <a name="skeleton"></a>

### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://www.balsamiq.com/).

The wireframes have examples of desktop, tablet, and mobile phone displays.

* [Home](docs/images/home.png)
* [About Us](docs/images/about-us.png)
* [Blog Post](docs/images/blog-post.png)
* [Register](docs/images/register.png)
* [Login](docs/images/login.png)

Overall, the finished project design is similar to what I had originally intended to create as per my wireframes. However, there are some different choices I have made for the end website such as:

* I have decided to remove the 'Recipes' section from the nav as per the original wireframes. The original intention was that a user can click on this and will be taken to a new page where they are able to view all the posted recipes. However, this was a redundant idea as the posts were already displayed on the 'Home' page. Therefore, for final submission I opted for a search bar to replace this. The user instead can utilise the search bar to locate specific recipes with the use of keywords which in return will present recipes (if any found).

* There are also some minor differences on the blog post section with the arrangement of the content.
